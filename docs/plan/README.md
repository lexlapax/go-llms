> **[Documentation Home](/REFERENCE.md) / Project Planning**

This directory contains the original planning documents for the Go-LLMs project. These documents represent the foundation and initial planning phase of the library.

## Documents

- [Design Inspirations](design-inspirations.md) - Key inspirations and design decisions
- [Coding Practices](coding-practices.md) - Coding standards and guidelines for the project
- [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md) - Detailed implementation plan with phases and milestones

These documents serve as historical references for understanding the project's origins and initial design decisions. They may not be fully aligned with the current implementation, as the project has evolved over time.
