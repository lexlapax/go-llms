# Dependency Optimization - Completed

## Summary
Successfully reduced binary size by 36% (from 9.9MB to 6.3MB) by replacing heavy dependencies with stdlib alternatives.

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Koanf with Direct YAML Parsing
- **Removed**: koanf/v2 and all subpackages
- **Replaced with**: Direct yaml.v3 unmarshaling + manual env var handling
- **Code changes**: 
  - New `config.go` using simple struct unmarshaling
  - Manual environment variable mapping
  - Backward compatible with existing config files

### 2. Replaced Kong/Kongplete with Stdlib Flag Package
- **Removed**: kong CLI framework and kongplete shell completion
- **Replaced with**: Standard library flag package
- **Code changes**:
  - Simplified `main.go` using flag parsing
  - Manual command routing
  - Removed shell completion feature

### 3. Simplified CLI Structure
- **Removed**: Complex command structure
- **Kept**: Basic commands (chat, complete, version)
- **Result**: Cleaner, simpler implementation

## Binary Size Comparison
- **Before**: 9.9MB (with koanf/kong/kongplete)
- **After**: 6.3MB (optimized version)
- **Reduction**: 3.6MB (36%)

## Dependencies Kept

```

## Trade-offs

### Features Lost
- Automatic shell completion
- Advanced configuration providers (koanf)
- Structured CLI with automatic help generation
- Some advanced commands (agent, structured)

### Benefits Gained
- 36% smaller binary
- Faster build times
- Fewer dependencies to manage
- Simpler, more maintainable code
- Reduced attack surface

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Existing YAML config files work
- ✅ Environment variables still supported
- ✅ Basic CLI functionality preserved
- ❌ Shell completion removed
- ❌ Some advanced commands simplified

## Test Results
- All unit tests pass
- Basic functionality verified
- Config loading works as expected

## Future Considerations
1. Could restore shell completion with manual implementation if needed
2. Advanced commands could be added back with careful implementation
3. Further optimization possible by replacing json-iterator with encoding/json

## Conclusion
The optimization successfully achieved the goal of reducing binary size while maintaining core functionality. The 36% reduction makes the tool more suitable for deployment scenarios where size matters.
