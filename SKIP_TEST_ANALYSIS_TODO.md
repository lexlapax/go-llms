# Skipped Tests Analysis

This document analyzes the skipped tests in the Go-LLMs codebase to provide clarity on why tests are skipped and what may be needed to enable them.

## Unit Test Skips

### 1. MultiProvider Schema Test
```
multi_primary_test.go:135: Skipping schema test due to compatibility issues
--- SKIP: TestPrimaryProviderDeterministic (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Schema compatibility issues with the MultiProvider's primary provider strategy
- **Action Needed**: Investigate compatibility issues between Schema type and the multi-provider implementation
- **Priority**: Medium - This affects the schema functionality with multi-providers

### 2. Agent Creation Tests in Utility Package
```
agent_test.go:12: Skipping test that requires access to workflow package internals
--- SKIP: TestCreateAgent (0.00s)

agent_test.go:53: Skipping test that requires access to workflow package internals
--- SKIP: TestAgentWithMetrics (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Tests in utility package require access to implementation details in the workflow package
- **Action Needed**: Either:
  1. Redesign tests to avoid dependencies on implementation details, or
  2. Move these tests to the workflow package where they have proper access
- **Priority**: Medium - Represents a design issue that should be addressed

### 3. Timeout Testing
```
agent_test.go:67: Skipping test that requires timeout testing

### 4. Process Typed With Provider
```
llmutil_test.go:748: Skipping test that requires mock provider
--- SKIP: TestProcessTypedWithProvider (0.00s)
```

- **Action Needed**: Enhance the mock provider to support the specific behaviors needed
- **Priority**: Medium - Utility function isn't being fully tested

### 5. Pool Schema Generation
```
pool_test.go:188: Skipping schema generation test due to mock issues
--- SKIP: TestPoolSchemaGeneration (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Mock provider doesn't properly handle schema generation requests
- **Action Needed**: Improve mock provider to support schema generation scenarios
- **Priority**: Medium - Pool functionality with schemas isn't being verified

### 6. Generate Typed
```
structured_test.go:45: Skipping TestGenerateTyped that requires mocking processor.ProcessTyped
--- SKIP: TestGenerateTyped (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Need to mock the processor.ProcessTyped function
- **Action Needed**: Create a testable interface or mocking strategy for ProcessTyped
- **Priority**: Medium - Core structured output functionality isn't fully tested

## Integration Test Skips

### 1. Agent Edge Cases
```
--- SKIP: TestAgentEdgeCases/OldToolCallDepthLimit (0.00s)

--- SKIP: TestAgentEdgeCases/SequentialToolCalls (0.00s)
--- SKIP: TestAgentEdgeCases/OldNestedToolCalls (0.00s)
--- SKIP: TestAgentEdgeCases/ToolParameterCoercion (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Tests for complex agent behaviors that may still be in development
- **Action Needed**: Complete implementation of edge case handling in agent system
- **Priority**: High - Represents potential gaps in agent functionality robustness

### 2. Gemini Tests
```
gemini_agent_e2e_test.go:20: Skipping Gemini agent tests due to potential service availability issues
--- SKIP: TestLiveEndToEndAgentGemini (0.00s)

gemini_e2e_test.go:18: Skipping Gemini tests due to potential service availability issues
--- SKIP: TestGeminiE2E (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Gemini API reliability issues or availability concerns
- **Action Needed**: Verify current stability of Gemini API and conditionally enable tests
- **Priority**: Medium - Depends on external service reliability

### 3. JSON Extractor Edge Cases
```
--- SKIP: TestJSONExtractorEdgeCases/MultipleJSONObjects (0.00s)
--- SKIP: TestJSONExtractorEdgeCases/MalformedButRecoverableJSON (0.00s)
--- SKIP: TestJSONExtractorEdgeCases/JSONFragments (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Complex JSON extraction scenarios that may not be fully implemented
- **Action Needed**: Enhance JSON extractor to handle these edge cases
- **Priority**: High - Impacts robustness of JSON extraction from LLM responses

### 4. Ollama Integration
```
ollama_integration_test.go:22: Skipping Ollama integration tests - set ENABLE_OPENAPI_COMPATIBLE_API_TESTS=1 to run
--- SKIP: TestOllamaIntegration (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Tests are conditionally disabled by default
- **Action Needed**: None - tests can be enabled with environment variable ENABLE_OPENAPI_COMPATIBLE_API_TESTS=1
- **Priority**: Low - Intentionally skipped but can be enabled when needed

### 5. OpenAI API Compatible Providers
```
openai_api_compatible_providers_test.go:21: Skipping OpenAI API Compatible Providers tests - set ENABLE_OPENAPI_COMPATIBLE_API_TESTS=1 to run
--- SKIP: TestOpenAIAPICompatibleProvidersIntegration (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Tests are conditionally disabled by default
- **Action Needed**: None - tests can be enabled with environment variable ENABLE_OPENAPI_COMPATIBLE_API_TESTS=1
- **Priority**: Low - Intentionally skipped but can be enabled when needed

### 6. Schema Validation Errors
```
--- SKIP: TestSchemaValidationErrors/ConditionalValidation (0.00s)
--- SKIP: TestSchemaValidationErrors/AnyOfValidation (0.00s)
--- SKIP: TestSchemaValidationErrors/OneOfValidation (0.00s)
--- SKIP: TestSchemaValidationErrors/NotValidation (0.00s)
```
- **Issue**: Advanced validation features that may still be in development
- **Action Needed**: Complete implementation of conditional validation features
- **Priority**: Medium - Affects advanced schema validation capabilities

## Summary

The skipped tests fall into several categories:

1. **API Access Issues**: Some tests require special API keys or services (Gemini, Ollama)
2. **Package Boundary Issues**: Tests in utility packages that need implementation details
3. **Mock Limitations**: Tests that require more sophisticated mocking than currently available
4. **Complex Features**: Edge cases and advanced features that are still in development

Most of these skips appear to be intentional and documented, not indicating actual problems with the codebase. They represent either:
- Features that are still being developed
- Tests that require complex setup or mocking that's not yet implemented
- Tests that are conditionally run based on environment variables or API availability

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **High Priority**:
   - Complete agent edge case handling (nested tool calls, parameter coercion, etc.)
   - Enhance JSON extractor to handle multiple objects and malformed JSON

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Address package boundary issues in utility tests
   - Improve mock provider capabilities for schema generation and specialized behaviors
   - Complete conditional validation features in the schema validation system

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Implement time mocking for timeout tests
   - Review Gemini API stability and re-enable tests if service is now reliable
