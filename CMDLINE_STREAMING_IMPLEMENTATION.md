# Command Line Streaming Implementation

## Design Analysis

### User Experience Goals

1. **Natural interaction**: Responses should appear progressively like a real conversation
2. **Responsive feedback**: User should see immediate activity when waiting for responses
3. **Configurability**: Users should be able to enable/disable streaming based on preference
4. **Cross-terminal compatibility**: Should work across different terminal environments
5. **Minimal interference**: Streaming shouldn't complicate the core interaction flow

### Implementation Phases

The implementation of streaming for the CLI was designed to be completed in multiple phases:

#### Phase 1: Basic Streaming with Auto-Detection

- Add `--stream` flag to CLI commands
- Implement auto-detection of terminal output
- Basic streaming implementation using provider's API
- Default to appropriate behavior based on context
- Add tests and documentation

#### Phase 2: Configuration and Session Control

- Add configuration file support for persistent preferences
- Implement interactive session commands for toggling streaming
- Add more granular streaming configuration options
- Preserve configuration across runs

#### Phase 3: Advanced Rendering Options

- Implement different visualization styles:
  - Character-by-character display
  - Token-by-token rendering
  - Typing effect with variable speeds
  - Progressive markdown rendering
- Allow users to choose rendering styles

#### Phase 4: Performance and UX Refinements

- Optimize performance for large responses
- Add better error handling and recovery
- Implement scrollback for streaming sessions
- Add visual indicators for streaming status
- Terminal-specific optimizations

## Phase 1 Implementation (Completed)

We have successfully implemented Phase 1 of streaming support for the Go-LLMs CLI chat feature. This initial implementation focuses on a simple yet effective approach that enhances the user experience with real-time responses.

### Summary of Changes

1. **Added Streaming Support to Chat Command**
   - Added `--stream` flag to explicitly enable streaming
   - Added `--no-stream` flag to explicitly disable streaming
   - Implemented auto-detection of terminal output to enable streaming by default in interactive sessions
   - Made stream and no-stream flags mutually exclusive

2. **Updated Chat Implementation**
   - Added streaming logic using the provider's `StreamMessage` API
   - Preserved conversation context by building the full response from tokens
   - Added clear user feedback about streaming mode status

3. **Added Tests**
   - Verified that stream and no-stream flags exist
   - Confirmed default values are correctly set to false
   - Tested explicit flag settings with both `--stream` and `--no-stream`
   - Ensured mutual exclusivity of flags

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added streaming information to the cmd/README.md file
   - Updated chat command documentation with flag details
   - Added examples showing how to use streaming options
   - Updated the chat example to show streaming behavior

### Files Modified

1. `/cmd/main.go`
   - Added stream and no-stream flags to the chat command
   - Implemented auto-detection of terminal output
   - Added streaming logic using `StreamMessage` for real-time responses
   - Preserved context management for conversation history

2. `/cmd/main_test.go`
   - Added `TestChatCmdStreamingFlag` with subtests for flag variations
   - Ensured tests pass for both existing and new functionality

3. `/cmd/README.md`
   - Updated with comprehensive streaming documentation
   - Added clear examples of streaming usage

### Key Implementation Details

#### Flag Definition and Mutual Exclusivity

```go
cmd.Flags().Bool("stream", false, "Stream responses in real-time (auto-enabled in interactive terminals)")
cmd.Flags().Bool("no-stream", false, "Disable streaming (useful for scripts or logging)")
cmd.MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive("stream", "no-stream")
```

#### Auto-detection Logic

```go
// Handle the no-stream flag explicitly
if noStreaming {
    useStreaming = false
} else {
    // Auto-detect if we should use streaming (if not explicitly set and we're in a terminal)
    if !cmd.Flags().Changed("stream") && !cmd.Flags().Changed("no-stream") {
        // Default to streaming if output is a terminal
        fileInfo, _ := os.Stdout.Stat()
        if (fileInfo.Mode() & os.ModeCharDevice) != 0 {
            useStreaming = true
        }
    }
}
```

This code automatically enables streaming when running in an interactive terminal, while disabling it for non-interactive usage (like piping to files or other commands).

#### Streaming Implementation

```go
if useStreaming {
    // Use streaming API
    var fullResponse strings.Builder
    tokenStream, err := llmProvider.StreamMessage(ctx, messages, options...)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "\nError: %v\n", err)
        continue
    }

    for token := range tokenStream {
        fmt.Print(token.Text)
        fullResponse.WriteString(token.Text)
        if token.Finished {
            fmt.Println()
        }
    }

    // Add assistant response to context for next round
    messages = append(messages, llmDomain.Message{
        Role:    llmDomain.RoleAssistant,
        Content: fullResponse.String(),
    })
} else {
    // Use standard API
    // ...
}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the provider's streaming API when streaming is enabled
2. Prints tokens in real-time as they arrive
3. Builds the full response for conversation context
4. Handles completion signaling

### Implementation Highlights

- **Auto-detection**: The implementation smartly enables streaming by default when running in an interactive terminal and disables it when output is redirected, ensuring the best experience without user configuration.

- **Explicit Control**: Users can override the auto-detection with explicit `--stream` or `--no-stream` flags, providing flexibility for scripts or various usage scenarios.

- **Mutual Exclusivity**: The `--stream` and `--no-stream` flags cannot be used together, preventing conflicting instructions.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: All aspects of the streaming feature are tested, including flag existence, default values, and explicit settings.

## Future Work (Phases 2-4)

Building on the successful implementation of Phase 1, future phases will focus on:

### Phase 2: Configuration and Session Control

- Add configuration file support for persistent streaming preferences:
  ```yaml
  # ~/.go-llms.yaml
  cli:
    streaming:
      enabled: true
      style: typing  # Options: typing, immediate, progressive
      speed: normal  # Options: slow, normal, fast
      show_tokens: false
  ```
- Implement interactive commands for toggling streaming during sessions:
  ```
  llm> /stream on
  Streaming is now enabled.
  ```
- Add more granular streaming configuration options
- Preserve configuration across runs

### Phase 3: Advanced Rendering Options

- Character-by-character display
- Token-by-token rendering
- Typing effect with variable speeds
- Progressive markdown rendering
- Rendering style selection options
- Handling of complex formatting (e.g., code blocks, tables)

### Phase 4: Performance and UX Refinements

- Optimize performance for large responses
- Add better error handling and recovery
- Implement scrollback for streaming sessions
- Add visual indicators for streaming status
- Terminal-specific optimizations
- Performance profiling and optimization

## Conclusion

This Phase 1 implementation delivers a clean, user-friendly solution for streaming chat responses in the CLI. By focusing on smart defaults with explicit override options, it provides a great user experience with minimal configuration, while still offering flexibility for advanced users.

The auto-detection approach provides a great user experience by defaulting to the most appropriate behavior based on context, making the feature both powerful and easy to use. The implementation follows Go best practices, ensuring code quality, test coverage, and comprehensive documentation.

The foundation established in Phase 1 sets the stage for more advanced features in future phases, which will further enhance the streaming capabilities of the Go-LLMs command-line interface.
