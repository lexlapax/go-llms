# Performance Optimization Notes

Based on benchmark results, we've identified several areas for optimization in the Go-LLMs library.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### 1. JSON Parsing and Validation (schema/validation)

**Observations:**
- Schema validation takes ~5-6μs per operation
- Complex nested object validation requires multiple memory allocations

**Recommendations:**
- Use object pooling for validation results and error collections
- Implement a more efficient validation for common schema types
- Consider specialized fast paths for schema types we know we'll use frequently
- Pre-allocate error slices with expected capacity
- Look into reusing JSON decoders instead of recreating them

### 2. Structured Output Processing (structured/processor)

**Observations:**
- JSON extraction takes ~4-5μs per operation
- Markdown code block processing adds minimal overhead

**Recommendations:**
- Optimize JSON extraction with more efficient regex patterns or specialized parsers
- Cache compiled regex patterns
- Add fast path for common response formats
- Consider pre-allocating memory for JSON buffer

### 3. Tool Execution (agent/tools)

**Observations:**
- Simple tools execute very quickly (~130-220ns)
- Struct parameter tools have significantly higher overhead (~1300ns)
- The reflection used for parameter conversion creates many allocations

**Recommendations:**
- Consider a more efficient parameter mapping mechanism
- Pre-compile common parameter types to avoid reflection costs
- Implement a parameter type cache to avoid repeated reflection
- Optimize json.Marshal/Unmarshal usage in tools

### 4. Agent Setup (agent/workflow)

**Observations:**
- Agent setup with multiple tools takes ~670ns
- Each tool adds memory allocations

**Recommendations:**
- Optimize how tools are registered and stored
- Explore more efficient ways to manage system prompts and hooks
- Consider lazy initialization of certain components

## Next Steps

1. Implement optimizations in order of potential impact:
   - Start with Tool parameter handling (highest allocations)
   - Optimize Schema validation for common types
   - Improve JSON extraction patterns
   - Add object pooling where appropriate

2. Benchmark after each optimization to measure improvement

3. Focus on memory allocations first, as they often impact performance more than CPU usage

4. Create specialized implementations for critical paths
