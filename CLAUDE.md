# Claude.md - Go-LLMs Project Guide

This document serves as a guide for Claude Code when working on the Go-LLMs project.

## Project Overview

Go-LLMs is a unified Go library for LLM integration that provides a simplified interface to interact with various LLM providers while offering robust data validation and agent tooling. It combines structured output processing (inspired by pydantic-ai), a consistent provider interface, and flexible agent workflows in a single, cohesive package.

## Project Structure

The project follows a vertical slicing approach where code is organized by feature:

```

## Go Coding Standards

1. Use idiomatic Go patterns (interfaces, composition over inheritance)
2. Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
3. Use interface-based design at domain boundaries
4. Apply clean architecture principles
5. Implement error handling using the standard Go error pattern
6. Ensure proper documentation for all exported types and functions
7. Write tests for all components (test-driven development)
8. Keep packages focused on a single responsibility

- âœ… Documentation consolidation and consistency

## Interface-Based Provider Option System Plan

An important enhancement in development is a new interface-based provider option system to support provider-specific options in a type-safe, extensible way.

### Implementation Plan Summary

1. **Design and Core Interfaces (Phase 1)**
   - Define core ProviderOption interface
   - Create provider-specific option interfaces (OpenAIOption, AnthropicOption, GeminiOption)
   - Implement common options (HTTPClient, BaseURL, Timeout, etc.)
   - Follow TDD approach with tests first

2. **Provider Refactoring (Phase 2)**
   - Update OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini providers to use the new option system
   - Create provider-specific options for unique features
   - Update all tests to verify the new option system works correctly

3. **Utility Function Updates (Phase 3)**
   - Update ModelConfig to include ProviderOptions
   - Modify CreateProvider to handle the new options
   - Update ProviderFromEnv to support provider-specific options via environment variables

4. **Examples and Documentation (Phase 4)**
   - Create examples demonstrating the new option system
   - Update existing examples to use the new approach
   - Update documentation to explain the new system

### Option System Design

```go
// Base interface for all provider options
type ProviderOption interface {
    // Identifies which provider type this option is for
    ProviderType() string
}

// Provider-specific option interfaces
type OpenAIOption interface {
    ProviderOption
    ApplyToOpenAI(*OpenAIProvider)
}

type AnthropicOption interface {
    ProviderOption
    ApplyToAnthropic(*AnthropicProvider)
}

type GeminiOption interface {
    ProviderOption
    ApplyToGemini(*GeminiProvider)
}
```

This approach follows Go's idiomatic interface design and enables type-safe, extensible option handling for all providers while supporting provider-specific options.
