  - [x] Create migration documentation
  - [x] Update all dependencies
  - [x] Result: Binary size increased from 11MB to 14MB
- [x] Phase 2: Analysis of Koanf/Kong Impact (Completed)
  - [x] Realized binary size increase was not acceptable
  - [x] Analyzed dependency tree and impact
  - [x] Created optimization analysis documents
  - [x] Identified stdlib-based approach as solution
- [x] Phase 3: Koanf/Kong to Stdlib Optimization (Completed)
  - [x] Removed koanf, replaced with direct YAML parsing
  - [x] Removed kong/kongplete, replaced with stdlib flag package
  - [x] Simplified CLI to basic commands (chat, complete, version)
  - [x] Maintained backward compatibility with config files
  - [x] Updated all tests to work with new implementation
  - [x] Result: Binary size reduced to 6.3MB (36% reduction)
- [x] Documentation Phase (Completed)
  - [x] Created comprehensive dependency reduction journey document
  - [x] Updated all relevant documentation with links
  - [x] Archived source materials in git history
  - [x] Document available at docs/technical/dependency_reduction.md

## Documentation (Completed)
