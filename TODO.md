# Go-LLMs Project TODOs

## Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive API documentation for all public interfaces
- [ ] Add detailed examples showing usage patterns for each component
- [ ] Document error handling patterns and best practices
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams for README

## Examples
- [ ] Add dedicated example for multi-provider with Consensus strategy
- [ ] Create example showing hooks for monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Add example demonstrating schema generation from Go structs

## Testing & Performance
- [ ] Add benchmarks for all components to ensure performance optimization
- [ ] Implement stress tests for high-load scenarios
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for error conditions

## Features
- [ ] Implement convenience functions for common operations
- [ ] Add more type coercion utilities for different data types
- [ ] Enhance the schema validation with more advanced features

## Documentation for Performance Optimization
- [ ] Document memory pooling strategies used
- [ ] Explain sync.Pool implementations and best practices
- [ ] Detail caching mechanisms and when they're applied
- [ ] Document concurrency patterns and thread safety

## Error Handling
- [ ] Ensure error handling consistency across all providers
- [ ] Create standardized error types for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Implement improved error context and error wrapping

## Additional providers
- [ ] Add Google Gemini api based provider
- [ ] Add Ollama local provider which is going to be very similar to OpenAI provider
