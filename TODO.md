## Architecture & Built-in Components for next release

### Agent Architecture Restructuring (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)

- [x] Phase 1 & 1.5: Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED (February 3, 2025) - see TODO-DONE.md
- [x] Phase 2: LLM Agent Migration - COMPLETED (February 3, 2025) - see TODO-DONE.md


- [x] Phase 3: Workflow Agents - COMPLETED (February 3, 2025) - see TODO-DONE.md

- [x] Phase 4: Agent-Tool Integration (Week 4) - COMPLETED (February 2025) - see TODO-DONE.md

- [ ] Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 5) (low priority)
  - [ ] State persistence and serialization, present plan before implementation
  - [ ] Agent discovery and registry, present plan before implementation
  - [ ] Advanced merge strategies for parallel agents
  - [ ] Streaming support for long-running agents

- [ ] Phase 6: Migration and Testing (Week 5-6) (high priority)
  - [ ] Come up with a more comprehensive plan to do the below first and redo this todo list - megathink
  - [ ] Remove old superfluos code, examples and tests
  - [ ] scan all product code for *backward compatibility* remove them and fix code to use new code.
  - [ ] no need for migration guide - update documentation to new codebase
  - [ ] scan all examples for Redo
    - [ ] Come up with an example plan based on codebase for product
    - [ ] remove invalid examples
    - [ ] Update Valid examples
    - [ ] Add missing examples
  - [ ] Comprehensive testing
    - [ ] Update integration tests to use core.LLMAgent (tests/integration/) (REVISIT)
    - [ ] Examine all integration tests to see which ones are needed, unneeded or need to be fixed, or new ones added and create a subtask list in todo.md
    - [ ] Update stress tests to use core.LLMAgent (tests/stress/) (REVISIT)
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking
    - [ ] move benchmarks directory under tests/
    - [ ] Update benchmarks to use core.LLMAgent (benchmarks/) (REVISIT)
    - [ ] Examine all benchmark tests to see which ones are needed, unneeded or need to be fixed, or new ones added and create a subtask list in todo.md

### Previous Built-in Components Plan
- [ ] P2: Build useful built-in tools
  - [x] Phase 2.6: Feed Process Tools (Completed - see TODO-DONE.md)

- [ ] P3: Build useful built-in agents (Phase 3 - POSTPONED until after architecture restructuring)
  - [ ] Text Agents
    - [ ] TextSummarize - intelligent summarization using LLM
    - [ ] TextExtract - extract structured data from text
    - [ ] TextAnalyze - sentiment, entities, keywords
    - [ ] TextTranslate - language translation using LLM
  - [ ] Research Agents:
    - [ ] WebResearcher - web research with source tracking
    - [ ] DocumentAnalyzer - analyze documents and PDFs
    - [ ] FactChecker - verify claims against sources
  - [ ] Coding Agents:
    - [ ] CodeReviewer - review code for issues
    - [ ] TestGenerator - generate tests from code
    - [ ] DocWriter - generate documentation
  - [ ] Data Agents:
    - [ ] DataAnalyst - analyze datasets and generate insights
